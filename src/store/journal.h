/* Transaction-log journaling — q/kdb's `-l` / `-L` ported to Rayforce.
 *
 * Wire format: every entry is a complete IPC message (16-byte
 * ray_ipc_header_t followed by serialized payload), so log frames
 * share parser code with the live IPC path.  Concatenation by `cat`
 * is valid by construction.
 *
 * Open with ray_journal_open(base, mode):
 *   1. If <base>.qdb exists, load it and bind every key into the global env.
 *   2. If <base>.log exists, replay it (badtail is fatal, eval errors warn).
 *   3. Open <base>.log for append.
 *
 * After open, the IPC dispatch hook (eval_payload in core/ipc.c) calls
 * ray_journal_write_bytes() for every inbound sync message before
 * evaluating it.  Async messages and responses are not journaled,
 * matching q's policy of journaling only the .z.ps stream.
 *
 * Replay is single-threaded by construction (it runs from main, before
 * the poll loop starts) so the module is intentionally not thread-safe;
 * the IPC dispatch loop is also single-threaded for eval_payload, so the
 * shared file handle does not need a mutex either.
