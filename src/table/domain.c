/*
 * domain.c -- Symbol-resolution domains (see domain.h).
 *
 * The FILE-domain reader is INDEPENDENT of g_sym/sym.c: it shares only
 * the on-disk STRL format knowledge (4-byte "STRL" magic, int64 count,
 * then count x [u32 len | bytes] records).  The ONLY touchpoint with
 * the global intern table is the runtime-id LUT build (sanctioned,
 * sequential) and the RAY_SYM_AUDIT failure path.
 *
 * Post-flip (Task 7b) a FILE domain is base + tail: the mmapped file at
 * open time plus in-memory appended symbols (ray_sym_domain_intern).
 * Append-only; positions are permanent; ray_sym_domain_flush persists
 * base+tail atomically under the symfile's flock.
 *
 * Concurrency: one global spinlock guards the cache list, FILE-domain
 * refcounts, appends, the lazily built reverse index and the runtime-id
 * LUT build.  Domain opens, interns (save merges / live inserts — all
 * inside sequential eval) and first-find index builds are rare.  The
 * two hot read paths are LOCK-FREE: ray_sym_domain_str reads the
 * atomically published (count, atoms) pair — appends publish a slot
 * write with a release store of the count, growth REPLACES the array
 * (old arrays are retired, never freed in place, so a stale pointer is
 * always valid memory covering every position < its publish count) —
 * and ray_sym_domain_runtime_lut reads an atomically published array
 * (invalidated and rebuilt across appends; retired likewise).  The
 * runtime singleton never touches the lock (immortal, delegates to
 * sym.c's own locking).

 *     with ray_str() there would land on a worker heap that the process-global
 *     domain cache outlives → use-after-free when that heap tears down.  The
 *     arena's chunks are thread-independent and freed only at dom_destroy.
 *   - ray_arena_str atoms carry RAY_ATTR_ARENA: ray_free / retain / release all
 *     no-op on them, so they are refcount-free and bulk-freed by the arena. */
