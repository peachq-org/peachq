/*
 * domain.h -- Symbol-resolution domains.
 *
 * A domain is the dictionary a RAY_SYM vector's indices resolve over.
 * Two kinds:
 *
 *   RUNTIME -- an immortal singleton wrapping the global intern table
 *              (g_sym, src/table/sym.c).  Every runtime-created SYM vec
 *              points at it.  retain/release skip it entirely (no atomic
 *              churn on the vec free hot path).
 *
 *   FILE    -- an mmapped symfile base (the STRL format) plus a growable
 *              in-memory tail of appended symbols, opened through a
 *              process-wide resolved-path-keyed refcounted cache:
 *              opening the same resolved path twice yields the SAME
 *              object — pointer equality is domain identity, always.
 *              The reverse index (find) is built lazily on first use;
 *              per-position string atoms are materialized EAGERLY at
 *              open / append and owned by the domain (borrowed by
 *              callers, exactly like ray_sym_str), making
 *              ray_sym_domain_str a lock-free array read.
 *
 * Position-0 reservation: position 0 of every non-empty FILE domain is
 * the empty string "" (mirrors global id 0 — the SYM null; group kernels
 * and null conventions treat id 0 as null).  ray_sym_domain_open
 * VALIDATES this and refuses (NULL) files that violate it; intern on an
 * empty domain seeds "" at position 0 before the first real symbol, so
 * newly created symfiles always carry it.  Empty vocabularies are fine.
 *
 * Growth (the flip, Task 7b): ray_sym_domain_intern find-or-appends into
 * the shared object — append-only, positions are permanent.  Appends
 * extend the published atom array by REPLACING it with a grown copy
 * (atomic publish; replaced arrays are retired, not freed, so lock-free
 * readers holding the old pointer stay valid for the domain's lifetime).
 * ray_sym_domain_flush persists base+tail via tmp + atomic rename under
 * the symfile's `.lk` flock and verifies the on-disk prefix still
 * matches what this object knows (anything else is a loud
 * concurrent-writer RAY_ERR_CORRUPT — never a silent remap).
 * Note: the spec's hold-the-`.lk`-for-the-writer's-lifetime contract is
 * deferred with multi-process writer stress (out of scope this phase);
 * the flock is taken per flush.
 *
 * Lifecycle: FILE domains are refcounted.  Every attached SYM column
 * holds a ref (taken on attach and in ray_retain_owned_refs, dropped on
 * vec free next to the str_pool/index owned-ref handling).  The cache
 * entry itself is weak: the last release unlinks the entry, munmaps the
 * base mapping and frees the lazy structures — a subsequent open builds
 * a fresh mapping.
