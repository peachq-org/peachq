 *   tbl              - source table.
 *   where_expr       - predicate AST.
 *   sort_key_syms[]  - column name syms to sort by (1..16).
 *   sort_descs[]     - per-key direction: 0=asc, 1=desc.
 *   n_sort_keys      - number of sort keys.
 *   k                - top-K size.
 *   out_col_syms[]   - source column name syms (one per output col).
 *   out_alias_syms[] - alias under which to publish each output col;
 *                       may be NULL when every alias matches the
 *                       corresponding out_col_syms entry.
 *   n_out            - count of output cols.
 *
 * Bypasses the DAG entirely: the predicate is compiled inline against
 * `tbl`'s columns; per-worker bounded heaps are merged after the parallel
 * scan; rows are gathered from `tbl` by index for the final output.
 * Source-column null bitmaps are propagated to the output so a nullable
 * select column survives a top-K gather (the planner gate previously
 * disallowed this).
 *
 * Returns NULL on shape miss (errors during predicate compile etc.) so
 * the caller can fall back to the unfused FILTER + SORT_TAKE path. */
