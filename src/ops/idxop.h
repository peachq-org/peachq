/*
 * idxop.h -- Per-vector accelerator indices.
 *
 * A vector with RAY_ATTR_HAS_INDEX set carries a child ray_t of type
 * RAY_INDEX in its aux[0..7] slot.  The index ray_t holds:
 *   - the kind (hash / sort / zone / bloom)
 *   - kind-specific payload (keys vec, perm vec, min/max, bloom bits)
 *   - a snapshot of the parent's original 16-byte aux union plus
 *     the relevant attrs bits, so detach can restore the vector to its
 *     pre-attach state byte-for-byte.
 *
 * Attach precondition: parent must not be a slice, must not already
 * carry an index, must be COW'd to rc==1 by the caller's path.
 *
 * Mutation invalidates: any in-place write to the parent vector must
 * call ray_index_drop() first AND clear RAY_ATTR_SORTED — a stale index
 * or a stale sorted marker is a wrong-answer bug (e.g. an asof-join that
 * trusts a false ordering claim).  Operators that build a fresh result
 * vector get this for free (fresh vectors start at attrs==0, no index).
