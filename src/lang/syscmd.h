/*
 * syscmd.h — single registry of system-level commands.
 *
 * One source of truth feeding three entry points:
 *
 *   1. `.sys.cmd "name args"`  — string-dispatched Rayfall builtin
 *   2. `:name args`            — REPL terminal command
 *   3. `(.sys.<name> arg)`     — direct typed Rayfall builtin (per entry)
 *
 * Each handler is invoked with one Rayfall arg (or RAY_NULL_OBJ for
 * commands that take none) and an optional REPL context that carries
 * the surface-specific state (color flag, repl pointer for things like
 * `:clear` and `:q`).  Handlers parse / coerce the arg themselves so
 * callers don't have to special-case whether `:t 1` came in as the
 * string "1" or the integer 1.
 *
 * Unknown command names dispatched through `.sys.cmd` fall through to
 * the host shell via system(2) — matches the kdb+ `system "..."`
 * convention so existing muscle memory works.
