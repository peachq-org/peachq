 * validate.c -- Null-model invariant validator (review item §2.1).
 *
 * Invariant 16.4: if a typed fixed-width column's payload contains a
 * type-correct *reserved* null sentinel, RAY_ATTR_HAS_NULLS MUST be set.
 *
 * Compiled only in DEBUG/ASAN builds (the whole TU collapses to nothing in
 * release via the #ifdef DEBUG guard below).  The release prototype in
 * vec.h expands ray_check_null_invariant(v) to ((void)0), so there is zero
 * cost on the hot path of a release binary.
 *
 * SCOPE — types whose null sentinel is TRULY RESERVED (unreachable as a
 * real value through normal ops), so a payload hit without HAS_NULLS is
 * unambiguously a producer bug:
 *   F64, F32        — any NaN bit pattern (x != x); the single-null float
 *                     model canonicalizes every non-finite to NULL_F64.
 *   I64, TIMESTAMP  — NULL_I64 (INT64_MIN).  64-bit arithmetic overflow is
 *                     guarded to null at every producer; INT64_MIN is never
 *                     a legitimate computed value.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT validated (return true / no-op):
 *   I16, I32 (+ DATE/TIME, which are I32-backed)
 *                   — DOCUMENTED EXCEPTION.  Narrow-int arithmetic wraps
 *                     modulo the type width (the k/q rule, see
 *                     test/rfl/expr/narrow_binary.rfl): 32767h + 1h == -32768h
 *                     and 2147483647i + 1i == -2147483648i are REAL wrapped
 *                     values that happen to equal NULL_I16 / NULL_I32.
 *                     Enforcing 16.4 here would force those results to read
 *                     back as null, contradicting documented wrap semantics.
 *                     The sentinel is therefore NOT reserved for I16/I32, so
 *                     they are out of the mechanism's scope.  (Producers that
 *                     INTEND an I16/I32 null still set HAS_NULLS via
 *                     ray_vec_set_null; this only declines to *assert* it.)
 *   BOOL, U8        — non-nullable, no sentinel.
 *   SYM             — no-null by design: ray_vec_is_null() short-circuits to
 *                     false for SYM regardless of payload, and sym-id 0 is a
 *                     legitimate (interned empty-string) value.
 *   STR, GUID       — the "sentinel" is an empty string / 16 zero bytes,
 *                     which is a LEGITIMATE ordinary value.  ray_vec_is_null
 *                     only treats it as null when HAS_NULLS is already set,
 *                     so an empty string WITHOUT HAS_NULLS is valid, not a
 *                     violation.  Forcing the bit here would be wrong.
 *   slices          — don't own the payload and never carry HAS_NULLS (the
 *                     parent does); ray_vec_is_null walks to the parent.
 *   zero-length     — nothing to scan.
 *
 * LIST/TABLE/DICT are recursed into (cheaply) so column results inside a
 * table flow through the same check.
 *
 * SAMPLING — to bound DEBUG cost on huge columns we do not always scan
 * every element.  Up to VALIDATE_FULL_SCAN_N elements are scanned in full;
 * beyond that we scan the first VALIDATE_HEAD_N, then a strided sample of
 * VALIDATE_SAMPLE_N positions across the remainder.  Producer COVERAGE
 * (which producer set is exercised) matters more than scanning every byte:
 * a producer that writes a sentinel without HAS_NULLS overwhelmingly writes
 * it in the head or hits the stride.  Full coverage of small/medium columns
 * (the common test shape) is exact.
